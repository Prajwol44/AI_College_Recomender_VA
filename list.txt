You're expert in Natural Language processing using Python.
I'm willing to build a chatbot type of application.
I have dataset of around 6k colleges as mentioned below in JSON format:
- college_name
- website
- email
- phone
- rating_value (overall college rating) (Example:)
- worst_rating (college rating collect from internet (bad))(Example:)
- best_rating (college rating collect from internet (good)) (Example:)
- courses (Multiple courses with name and fee amount) (Example:)
- city
- state
- approvals (who is governing body of college) (Example: )


       {
         "college_name": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences - [AIIMS]",
        "website": "http://www.aiims.edu",
        "phone": "011-26588500",
        "email": "director@aiims.edu",
        "rating_value": 4.3,
        "review_count": "245",
        "worst_rating": 0,
        "best_rating": 5,
          "city": "New Delhi",
        "state": "Delhi NCR",
        "approvals": "MCI, UGC"
        "courses": [
            {
                "course_name": "Operation Theatre Technology",
                "fee_amount": 3385
            },
            {
                "course_name": "Medical Radiology & Imaging Technology",
                "fee_amount": 4480
            },
        ]
       }

User can ask questions or prompts about college finding based on city, rating, courses, fee structures.
Example Prompts:
1. Can you recommend colleges in [City Name] with good ratings (3-4 stars) that offer [Course Name]?
2. Does the college offering [Course Name] in [City Name] have approval from [specific body]?
3. What are the best-rated colleges in [City Name] for [Course Name]?

Based on the user question, my app will suggest 3-5 colleges data from the dataset.
Guide me building the chatbot using python streamlit and best NLP techniques, as i cannot use cloud APIS in this project.
